# we have a different name for this command, because the chance of
# forgetting a parameter is high and accidentally running a proper
# mulle-project-distribute is hard to roll back. A prerelease is clobbering
# the original "prerelease" branch. You should merge with "release" only,
# prerelease is a oneway street.
